# wolfyutilities Folder
The folder where all the java source files start

### About
All right so as I said in frist README.md I'm going add 1 for every source file now.

### Small Talk About Main.java
ok so something I sould say is I'm not going to talk about every little tiny thing about the code just going to say whats on it the best I can ok, frist thing package what that maens is another form of folders in java projects, now import is the things you add if your going to add other code from another source.

Thats all I'm talk about for now the rest I really can't talk about I'v been useing a YouTube video to code if it was something I changed then I will talk about it for you guys.
