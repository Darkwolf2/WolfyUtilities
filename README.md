# WolfyUtilities
It's my minecraft mod

### About
WolfyUtilities is my frist ever Minecraft mod, I have never made one before It's my frist time, I'm hoping it will turn out awesome & become useful to Minecraft modding fans or just something cool to have for your Minecraft world etc.

All right so as you may know looking at this README I have 2 branches master & Alpha-Stage, So the reason I have 2 is because the master branch is where I'm going to add source code files with all the code I been using, Now the Alpha-Stage is where I'm going to add all the items and blocks and other new things to my mod.

Another thing is I'm going to do is I'm going to have a README.md for every individual file, unless there's 2 or more in same place then I'll just use 1 README.md to talk about both or more if need be.
